     I am Dolkar Tsesang, 35 years old. Born in a small village in the estern part of Tibet, I have been living away from my family since 2003. My parents and siblings are living in Tibet. Once or twice a week, I talk to them per video call. I miss my family very much and hope to see them soon....  I love meeting people and share my experiences with them.</br>In order to be able to earn my living, I have been working in restaurants. I first worked in a Chinese restaurant for two years and for the last three years I have been working in an Italian style restaurant with a Turkish owner. </br> In my free time, I have been improving my German and English and learning how to code.
